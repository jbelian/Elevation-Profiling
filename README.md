## Interpolating trail datasets into a digital elevation model

For this 3D map of Bryce Canyon National Park, I interpolated trail shapefiles into a digital elevation model of the area. I split the trails into each named segment, generated a stack profile for each, and displayed each elevation profile as separate charts, as shown in the picture below.
